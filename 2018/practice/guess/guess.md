# Number Guessing

We are thinking of an integer `P` within the range `(A,B]` — that is, `A < P ≤ B`. You have `N` tries to guess our number. After each guess that is not correct, we will tell you whether `P` is higher or lower than your guess. 

## Input and output

This problem is interactive, which means that the concepts of input and output are different than in standard Code Jam problems. You will interact with a separate process that both provides you with information and evaluates your responses. All information comes into your program via standard input; anything that you need to communicate should be sent via standard output.
